///
/// @dev  ── Four modes, auto-selected by `block.chainid` (+ one env AFFIRMATION on 4663 — the bare
///          `forge script … --broadcast` verify command still works out of the box for the dev
///          contexts; only a real mainnet deploy needs the affirmation, decision #5):
///        - LIVE (`block.chainid == 4663` AND `ROBBED_DEPLOY_ENV == "mainnet"`): the four V3
///          addresses + WETH come from `constants.json.external.*`; `require(weth == 0x0Bd7…AD73)`
///          (F-2), a real `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, and a non-zero treasury Safe (O-6 fail-closed) are
///          enforced; the artifact is written to the canonical `deployments/4663.json` with
///          `mode:"live"`.
///        - FORK (`block.chainid == 4663`, affirmation ABSENT — the default): a mainnet-fork run
///          (anvil `--fork-url`, the docker `deploychain` one-shot / I-2 dev stack). Same 4663
///          chainid and the same external-address + F-2 canonical-WETH discipline as LIVE, but the
///          keyless anvil signer fallback is allowed and the artifact is labeled `mode:"fork"` so a
/// fork pipeline can NEVER produce a `mode:"live"` 4663 registry entry (/ T-5). A
///          real deploy later overwrites `4663.json` with `mode:"live"`.
///        - TESTNET (`block.chainid == 46630`, official Robinhood Chain testnet — chain id per
/// docs.robinhood.com/chain/connecting, recorded in docs/developers/runbooks/testnet.md) public-
///          chain discipline, exactly like LIVE — a real `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` is REQUIRED (the

///          addresses (WETH, V3 factory/NPM/router/quoter, treasury Safe) come from the constants
///          file's `external.*` (default `../tools/m0/out/constants.testnet.json`, the T-1 derive
/// output — ZERO testnet addresses are hardcoded here), the V3 runtime assertions
///          + the O-6 `TreasurySafeUnset` guard run unchanged, and ownership is handed to the
///          (dev-signer) treasury Safe. The ONLY live-mode check skipped is the F-2 canonical-WETH
///          literal — `0x0Bd7…AD73` is a chain-4663 fact; testnet WETH is whatever the Phase-T
///          inventory recorded in the constants file (wrong values still fail `assertV3Wiring`).
/// - LOCAL smoke (any other chain id, e.g. anvil 31337) the canonical addresses have
///          NO code on a fresh anvil, so we deploy the REAL precompiled Uniswap V3 core+periphery
///          bytecode + a MockWETH9 locally (the M1-10 {V3Fixture} pattern) and point the stack at
///          them — so `V3Assertions.assertV3Wiring` runs against a genuinely live local V3 and the
///          canary exercises the real pool-init math. The F-2 canonical-WETH require is skipped
///          locally BY DESIGN (the mock is not `0x0Bd7…AD73`); every OTHER assertion still runs.
///
///       ── Design decisions (owned by robbed-contracts; recorded here + in the final report):
///        1. Deploy artifact is written by the SCRIPT via `vm.serialize*`/`vm.writeJson`, NOT parsed
///           by the codegen from `broadcast/…/run-latest.json`. Options weighed: (a) parse the
///           broadcast receipt — rejected: the six contracts include a CREATE2 curve + CREATE token
///           minted by the factory (not top-level txs), so name→address mapping is fragile; (b) a
///           self-describing artifact — chosen: the script already holds every typed address, so it
///           emits an authoritative, flat, deterministic JSON. Simulation and on-chain nonces match,
///           so the recorded addresses equal the broadcast addresses. Basis: Foundry JSON cheatcodes
///           (getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes — `serialize*`/`writeJson`).
///        2. `block.chainid` (+ the decision-#5 affirmation for the live/fork split of 4663) selects
///           mode — the bare `forge script … --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast` still works
///           for local + fork. 46630 is the official testnet id and gets the public-chain (testnet)
///           branch — before this split it would have wrongly taken the local mock-V3/dev-key branch.
///        3. Local/fork signer fallback to the PUBLIC anvil account-0 key when `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`
///           is unset — never on a PUBLIC chain (live OR testnet: `revert MissingDeployerKey`).
///           Keeps the bare smoke/fork command keyless while never risking a real deploy without an
///           explicit key.
///        4. Public modes cross-check `constants.chainId == block.chainid` (`ConstantsChainIdMismatch`)
///           so mainnet constants can never be broadcast to testnet or vice versa — the constants
/// file is the single source of externals, so a chain/file mix-up must fail
///           closed BEFORE any spend. Local mode skips it (the 31337 smoke legitimately reuses the
///           4663-derived economics; a 4663 fork loads the fork fixture whose `chainId` is 4663 too).
///        5. FORK vs LIVE split of chain 4663 is an env AFFIRMATION (`ROBBED_DEPLOY_ENV == "mainnet"`),
/// fail-SAFE by construction — / the T-5 chain-identity gate. Options weighed:
///           (a) auto-detect a fork in-EVM — REJECTED: no cheatcode/opcode distinguishes a fork of
///           4663 from real 4663 (both report chainid 4663, `arbBlockNumber`/`block.timestamp` track
/// the forked chain), the exact ambiguity records; (b) treat 4663 as live by default
///           and require a `ROBBED_FORK` opt-OUT — REJECTED: fail-DANGEROUS (forgetting the flag mints
/// a false `mode:"live"` fork artifact, precisely the defect that motivated, whose
///           anvil-treasury `4663.json` was already mislabeled `live`); (c) CHOSEN: live is opt-IN via
///           an explicit affirmation, so the default 4663 run is a `Fork` and only a deliberate
///           `ROBBED_DEPLOY_ENV=mainnet` produces a `mode:"live"` canonical entry. The dangerous state
///           requires affirmative intent; the common (fork) path is safe by omission. Basis: Foundry
/// `vm.envOr` (getfoundry.sh cheatcodes); protects the registry-mode invariant.
///           The label is the sole distinguisher — the fork artifact still lands at `4663.json` (a
///           real deploy overwrites it) because the LOCAL fork stack's indexer resolves its externals
///           from the `"4663"` registry entry, so that key must exist; `mode:"fork"` keeps it
