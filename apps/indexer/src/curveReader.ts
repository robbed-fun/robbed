/**
 * Per-curve immutable reader (spec §12.38/§12.40d; indexer.md §3.1).
 *
 * At `TokenCreated` the indexer reads the freshly-deployed `BondingCurve`'s
 * public immutables straight from chain via viem + the shared `bondingCurveAbi`.
 * This supersedes the M2-4 env interim (`CURVE_SUPPLY_WEI` &c.) now that the
 * read-ABI is in `@robbed/shared/abi` (const-asserted).
 *
 * Why per-curve and NOT `CurveFactory.config()` (the M1-3b / §12.40 #39
 * divergence): the five curve-shape values (`VIRTUAL_ETH_0`, `VIRTUAL_TOKEN_0`,
 * `CURVE_SUPPLY`, `LP_TOKEN_TRANCHE`, `GRADUATION_ETH`) are `internal immutable`
 * on `CurveFactory` and are NOT surfaced by `config()`; `FactoryConfig` only
 * carries the *factory-current* defaults that govern FUTURE curves. Likewise
 * `TRADE_FEE_BPS` on an older curve differs from the factory's live
 * `tradeFeeBps` after any `setTradeFeeBps` — so the per-token fee MUST come from
 * the curve, never the factory (§12.40d). Reading each curve is the only
 * correct source for a curve created under prior parameters.
 *
 * Cost: `createToken` is low-frequency (not a hot path, §12.40d), so a bounded
 * set of `readContract` calls per creation is acceptable. We use individual
 * reads (Promise.all) rather than `multicall` deliberately: viem `multicall`
 * requires a Multicall3 deployment at the canonical address, whose presence on
 * chain 4663 is unverified (§13). Individual `readContract` calls have no such
 * dependency and cannot silently return a wrong/aggregated value — the boring,
 * can't-corrupt-derived-data choice. Ponder's client caches + dedupes RPC
 * responses at the event's block, so re-delivery/reorg re-reads are cheap.
 *
 * PURE + injectable: the handler passes Ponder's `context.client`; tests pass a
 * stub implementing {@link ContractReader}. The ABI is imported from
 * `@robbed/shared/abi`, never redeclared.

 * Event-block read with a pruned-state FALLBACK at `latest` (decision recorded

 *
 * The primary path is the deterministic, Ponder-cached event-block read
 * (`context.client`). But on a NON-ARCHIVE RPC the historical state can be
 * pruned — observed live on the official public testnet RPC during the §12.55
 * reindex: `eth_call` at the TokenCreated block returned "missing trie node"
 * consistently (3/3 probes) once the block was ~40 min old, which killed the
 * backfill. The fallback re-reads via a plain viem client at `latest`, which is
 * VALUE-IDENTICAL here because every function read is a Solidity `immutable`
 * (constructor-set, embedded in the deployed bytecode; `BondingCurve` has no
 * selfdestruct) — the module doc above already records "block choice is
 * immaterial". The fallback bypasses Ponder's RPC cache deliberately: Ponder's
 * `context.client` rejects `blockTag` overrides (ponder.sh/docs/indexing/
 * read-contracts, verified 2026-07-12), and the values persist into the
 * `tokens` row anyway, so replay determinism holds at the value level — exactly
 * the guarantee immutability grants. Alternative weighed: pinning the fallback
 * to a recent concrete block (cacheable) — rejected: it re-prunes eventually
 * and adds a head-lookup; `latest` cannot go stale for immutables.
